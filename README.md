## Overview

This dashboard provides interactive visualizations of search performance data, allowing users to analyze competitor search trends over time. It features a monthly line chart and quarterly heatmap visualization with comprehensive filtering capabilities.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.x with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts (line chart), custom implementation (heatmap)
- **State Management**: React Hooks with context
- **Data Fetching**: SWR with custom caching strategies
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Features

- Interactive search trend visualizations
- Comprehensive filtering system
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliant accessibility
- Performance-optimized with code splitting and memoization
- Secure implementation with proper CSP headers

## Performance Optimizations

- React.memo for heavy components
- Code splitting with dynamic imports
- SWR for efficient data fetching and caching
- Responsive image optimization

## Accessibility

This project follows WCAG 2.2 AA guidelines:

- Proper semantic HTML
- ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance
- Screen reader support

## Security

Security measures implemented:

- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP security headers
- Input validation
- XSS protection

## CI/CD

Continuous integration and deployment is set up with GitHub Actions:

- Automated linting and type checking
- Build verification
- Automatic deployment to Vercel

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **UI Layer**: React components for visualization and user interaction
2. **Data Layer**: SWR-based hooks for data fetching with caching
3. **State Layer**: React context for global state management
4. **API Layer**: Typed API client for data retrieval
